A curated list for awesome EKS resources
Inspired by https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome[@sindresorhus' awesome]

== What is EKS

Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) is Amazon Web Services' (AWS)
managed Kubernetes cluster. It allows you to simply create a managed `etcd` and
master infrastructure connecting into your AWS account for the worker nodes.

== Justification

@christopherhein has already done a great job at curating a thorough list of
https://github.com/christopherhein/awesome-eks[ Awesome EKS ] but the list contains mainly links to AWS blogs. 
This list is intended to be community list for deploying EKS on AWS .
I also included "Additional resources" to cover additional K8s interesting aspects  .
